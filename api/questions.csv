Question (Reddit post),Reddit response,LLM response
"Sometimes I feel alienated from ""regular people"". People who do not do opioids. So I do not always have people to talk to, even about non opioids related subject matter. You all having a good day? If anyone is struggling with loneliness feel free to talk as well. I know that sometimes life is hard and it helps to have people to turn to to talk about things.","Last days were really good, I got my drivers licence and got accepted to a university. I have been sober for a year, but lately I have been feeling like I should celebrate with some opioids, because even though I have managed to do a lot of things, I still dont feel completely happy. I know it is a bad idea, so I will try not to do it.",
"I celebrated six years clean and, people keep saying how proud they are of me when i share my story, but I am not proud. I fight the craving every single day. I remember so vividly how good opiates made me feel. Does this feeling ever go away? It is honestly haunting. I know that for every addict relapse is just one step away. I refuse to take that step. I never will. I know how much better I am when I am sober. I know using does not make life any easier, but sometimes it made things more bearable. That is the trouble with drugs, it starts out as fun until it is not anymore. I will not relapse.","The craving will never go away. This is unfortunately the scientifically proven truth. Instead of fighting the fear of craving, try embracing it as a darkness that is simply a necessary yin to the yang of life. Congrats on 6 years!",
"Anyone have tips for how to prove to people you are sober? It is really hard when everyone that matters to me doubts that I am still clean. To be honest, I have been super close to relapsing but still have not.",I am sorry that nobody is believing in you right now. Just focus on yourself and on remaining off of opioid use. Good luck!,
I have been dependent on suboxone (medication-assisted treatment against opioids) for 3 to 4 years. I am worried that I am just trading one addiction for another. I will end up addicted to both opioids and suboxone. Do others also feel the same?,"Yes, with suboxone, I traded one addiction for another. But 2 years later I'm employable, functional, have money in the bank, and don't hate my life. I traded a hellish existence for a decent life. Yes, I'm addicted to suboxone now, but this addiction is an angel compared to the devil that was opioid addiction. I honestly could quit using suboxone if I chose to. ",
How to stay sober?,I know that exact feeling! Get in contact with people who are in recovery man! They will save you. Take care!,
Hey everyone! I want to be done with opioids once and for all. I have enrolled into a medication-assisted treatment program and have an upcoming appointment coming up soon. What should be my plan of action?,"Talk to the doctor! That will give you some accountability, and because they'll get to know you personally, they will know the best plan for helping you get straightened out. You will get through this!",
"I have been on suboxone for about 6 weeks now, and I am having a lot of side effects. Can anyone offer advice? Mainly I am sleepy all the time. Also, I feel like suboxone puts me in a state of mind to want to use more opioids than I normally would, so I have had some frequent relapses. Can anyone tell me if they have had similar experiences, and how they coped, if they continued suboxone?","What’s your dosage and what was opioid opiate habit like? It all depends on that. Sounds like you might be on too large of a dose for suboxone. I’ve been on and off suboxone for a couple years, but I’ve been on every possible dosage at one point or another. Too low of a dose, you experience opioid withdrawal; too high of a dose, you’ll get sleepy. Suboxone did nothing to subside the urge to use opioids for me.",
"I keep being told that methadone blocks the effects of heroin and other opiates. I have read that it does and the doctor at the clinic told me it does, but I do not buy it. It does not make sense to me. The doctor kept telling me my dose just was not high enough yet, so she kept increasing it, saying that the right dose would block the effects of opioids and I would not get high from those. I still get high when I use opioids. Why am I being told that methadone can block the effects of opioids? Am I missing something?","You need to stop using opioids with methadone. You will never reach a dose of methadone that blocks opioids. It's not possible. You definitely need to learn some self control or you will never recover. 

Methadone is just a tool. It can help you if you work it. You can't just take it and expect life to improve. I was a hopeless junkie for 10 years. I would rob from my grandma if it meant I could get high. At some point you got to just hit rock bottom and decide you're done. 

Maybe it will take being homeless and jobless to have that moment but I sure hope not. I wish you the best!",
I know I can't just be sober without some form of help. But I don't know if methodone is the best route to recovery. Are the side effects worth the help? ,"Methadone worked wonders for me. If you really want to quit opioids like I did, but can’t take the months of depression, then jump on methadone and get your life back. I am so happy I did.",
"I have decided to quite methadone. I have been going for 13+ years. Sunday I took a full dose and last monday I took half a dose. So far so good, just some moderate irritation. Any advice on how long this will last and what I should do?","My advice is meant in the best possible way, and my advice would be to go talk to the treatment clinic today and let them know you made a mistake. You feel fine today, so what happens if it’s too much to bear tomorrow and you can’t get up and feed yourself? Are we going to come over and help? It took me a really long time to unlearn that doing things alone was not the same as being independent. The more I involved other people and support in what I was doing, the more it helped. I just have to say for other people that doing what you did is stupid and dangerous, hope it works out for you though. It’s like a 45+ day process to feel completely fine.",
Is there anyone from oklahoma? How did/do you cope with withdrawals? I am trying again to get off of everything but literally having one of the worst times I have had in a long time. I am trying to figure out how to get on methadone.,If your addiction is to opioids/opiates suboxone or methadone may assist you greatly. Medication-assisted treatment has saved many lives. Mine included. If you are unable to withdraw on your own I would contact your local methadone clinic for information and direction.,
I made a mistake and used opioids while on methadone (medication-assisted treatment). How long will the opioids typically hang around in your system? I have heard anywhere from 2 to 12 days from people and 2 to 4 days from google searche. Any input is greatly appreciated. Thanks.,3 days is typical. I've never once had it stay beyond the 72 hour mark. Good luck and get back on the wagon!,
"Yesterday and today I have slept in past my normal methadone treatment dosing time and had dreams of being sick and stuck waiting on the opioid dealer. Like in my dreams I am just absolutely sick as I can be. Does this happen to anyone else? It was so intense. I am not using opioids right now, i am stable and fine at with the methadone medication-assisted treatment. Now that I am awake, I do not feel sick. It was just in my dreams and it was so real.","I am like 4 months in at the methadone clinic and haven't used since the very beginning so over 3 months without using opioids. I have also fortunately never missed a methadone dose. But still once a week, I dream that I am sick from opioid use, filled with dread and anxiety and hopelessly stressing over making it through the night. And then I wake up so confused because I don't feel sick. It always takes a minute to fully process/realize that I dont have to worry about being sick anymore and it is such a relief.",
I have been having attacks where suddenly out of no where I start to get hot. Sweat starts to build up on my forehead and face and work its way down and then extreme nausea sneakers in! I can't move without feeling worse. I take 110 mg of methadone daily (no other medication or opioids). I am having severe anxiety and do not want to leave the house because I do not know when or where its going to hit! Could the methadone maybe have my hormones off balance? Or be messing with my body in some way?,"This started to happen to me! It started happening at random times, then I realized it was happening around that time of the month (periods).

It might be your hormone levels that can cause cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, extreme sweating etc.

Obviously, I’ve been dealing with this too and have been reading and researching. All this has nothing to do with methadone.

My coping tools: ginger candy, ginger ale, and accupressure.",
"I have been on methadone for 7 months, and in the last 2 months I have been waking up some mornings feeling extremely nauseated. Then it will slowly fade. Does anyone know if this is methadone related? Like is my dose wrong or something? Or is it maybe something completely unrelated?","It sounds like you possibly may need to try increasing your dosage a bit? Or you may be a fast metabolizer, where your body is metabolizing the medication so fast that you’re already experiencing withdrawal symptoms before the 24 hours are up. 

Have you mentioned this to your counselor or dosing nurse? They can do testing to see if you are a rapid metabolizer. If you are, some clinics will allow you to ""split dose"", where instead of taking your dose one time in the morning, it’s split up between smaller doses multiple times throughout the day. Or you may just need a dose increase. 

I was going through the same at one point in time. I would dose early in the morning, and by bedtime I was starting to hurt and feel uneasy. A lot of times I wouldn’t sleep well and I’d just be watching the clock and waiting until my clinic opened so I could go dose. My particular situation ended up needing a small increase, and a split dose. 

Also there’s always a possibility that it’s unrelated to methadone. Do you have any other health issues that this could be resulting from? How long has it been happening? Do you take your dose at the same time everyday? 

Maybe mention it to your clinic, and if it hasn’t been happening for long, give it a bit of time to see if it goes away or if it’s something else? If not see what the clinic suggests. Good luck, I hope they get it figured out!",
"I switched from methadone to suboxone, hoping that suboxone is easier to get off of. Heard mixed results. Anybody have experience?","As a methadone patient that works in this field I can share my experience. Many years ago, I slowly got off methadone and the withdrawal was manageable. I have never been on suboxone but have worked with many who have. In my opinion, most withdraw from suboxone far easier then methadone. It's important to remember that withdrawl is a unique process that is patient specific. Comfort medications, support, dedication, perception and pain tolerance all factor into this process.",
"I had a couple weeks clean, I hit a stress wall and caved into my usual opioid habit. Why do I keep doing this to myself?!","I am over 10 years in the constant opioid addiction cycle of using and then having withdrawal symptoms during recovery. In all that time, each year and cycle getting worse and worse, I constantly built onto the delusion that I could never live without these drugs, that for me, sober equaled suicide. 

That became my most core belief. The one thing I could say to myself and believe fully, without a doubt. Opioids have this brilliant yet subtle deceitfulness to them. Pushing you to delude yourself into thinking you have no choice when a choice is the only thing you really have.

I am just over 72 hours clean from opioids. The pain is still almost unbearable, but I decided I want to live, and I never want to live like that again. I am now finally ready to pay back everything drugs have lent me the last 10 years. 

I don’t know what the moral of this story is, maybe it’s the whole “when you’re at rock bottom, the only way to climb is up” saying. But all I know for sure is 3 days ago I thought I would be on opioids forever, and now I don’t.",
"Fellow opioid addicts, where do you see yourself 5 years from now?",I hope to be clean 4 years or so from any medication-assisted treatment drugs. It’s the last hurdle for me. Clean and sober with a better paying job and a home! One thing at a time! Hope everyone is careful and has a good day!,
"I am quitting opioids again tomorrow, or at least getting through a detox. However, I am a little concerned. The times when I have actually had a lot of success with detoxing has usually been when I have ruined my life significantly. That makes me want to stop using opioids and take finally accountability for my usage. This time I have got nothing like that except for my family asking me not to. Just wondering if anyone has got any tips that might make me absolutely loathe opioids?","If you’re quitting only for your family, it’s not going to work. You’re going to either relapse or end up resenting them for “making” you quit.
This is from personal experience. Quit opioids for yourself!",
"I have relapsed counless times from opioid addiction. A lot of us seem to be able to quit but, as we know, the period after is the harder part. When the cravings start. My thought is we get bored within our own brain and want to escape that boredom, even knowing the repercussions. How do you fight off the boredom that leads to cravings and is that your problem as well?","Currently having this problem too. I write out lists for myself to structure my day. I’ve heard working out is fantastic for you in recovery, I doordash so I’m always able to take a ride to clear my mind. So yeah, I know exactly what ur talking about and it’s so hard!",
Will methadone or suboxone (medication-assisted treatments) help with opioid withdrawal symptoms and how fast can I get a prescription so I can start this process?,Suboxone or methadone (and other medication-assisted drugs) will 100% help but I advise you to not get on. Once you’re on either it’s much harder to get off them.,
I am quitting opioids. What is the best possible way to get off them? Please tell me what has really helped you and what really helped others.,"If you have health insurance, get yourself an appointment with a psychiatrist and they will prescribe everything you need even medication-assisted treatment. You'll be fine even if you dont have insurance. The visit is no more than $160 and they will provide everything you need for a safe detox.",
What should I do to come off of opioids?,"Just taper down the usage at a pace you're comfortable with, it varies from person to person. For example, if you can manage using say 5 mg less each week, do that. Some people cope with quitting opioids easier than others. The post-withdrawal syndrome can be harder than the opioid withdrawal. Lots of people can get off of opioids, but less can ""stay off"".",
Is it possible to seriously quit opioids and be happy after?,"I was a user for 20 years and I have been completely clean since April 2019 (I know some people don’t consider you clean on medication-assisted treatment but I consider myself clean) thanks to methadone. I never thought I could stop using opoids. It was hard but I stuck it out one day at a time. Now I’m the general manager at a restaurant, I just bought a beautiful house, I drive a 2019 Toyota RAV4, I make $60,000 a year and have money in the bank. I know those are just regular things most people have but to me they were impossible dreams not that long ago. I’ve found peace and happiness. I’m not saying it’s all rainbows and cupcakes but it’s definitely better than the alternative. Good luck in whatever path you choose!",
"This month I have been just a little over one month sober. Took me 6 years to finally get sober for me and my family, but for some reason today I decided to use opioids. I do not know what it was. I have been on suboxone for the past year. I do not want to go back to being a non functional, sick all the time, money stealing, opioid addit. Moral of the story: no matter how much you love opioids, it will never be worth your beautiful lives.","I've been in sober living for a couple months. Unfortunately, wanting/desire is an emotion and emotions aren't controlled by the logical parts of our brain. The powerful sense of relief drugs provide, or once provided, carve deep neural imprints that never completly fade. I had eight years clean before so I'm speaking form experience. When the urge comes it's heavy.  

Watch out for stress, statistically it's the #1 trigger for relapse. The most common causes for stress are: uncertainty, loneliness/isolation, lack/loss of control, and displacement. I suggest considering if one of those has become overwhelming and try to talk to someone about it.  

There's no need to be hard on yourself. Addiction is characterized by relapse. It's actually listed as a symptom and it's used to diagnose people. 

I wish you the best of luck. I really do.",
"Are you in recovery, or trying/wanting to get clean from opioids?",I would like to say I am in recovery from opioids. I still think about using. My addict brain is still very active and I might relapse one day but am trying to stay clean.,
I finally quit my opioid use but I feel that I am weak. I am an embarrassment to myself and everyone else. Anyone else ever feel like that?,"This is so normal. I am sorry you’re feeling this way, but at this point in sobriety we all feel this to some extent. We’re having to face everything that our addiction has cost us, everything it has cost our friends and loved ones, and the long road ahead of us toward feeling some sense of normality. It's an awful and overpowering feeling, and it sends some people running to relapse in order to not have to face it.

But don’t despair, keep doing what you’re doing and stay sober because things do get better. You’ll begin to sleep more normally, and at some point in the next month or two you can push yourself to start exercising. Regular appetites, the rewarding feeling from completing a walk/run/workout and notching that new goal, all of those things. Use the coming weeks to set up some kind of addiction counseling (and, depending on what your doctor or counselor recommends, possibly a psychiatrist as well.) This is helpful to address some of the feelings that contributed to addiction and is a place where you can be honest and talk about what's going on, what you feel, what you’re worried about and all that. 

Right now though, just focus on getting through the next 5 minutes/20 minutes/half hour/hour/3 hours and so on and keep on doing what you’re doing. Distractions, in whatever form works for you, can be so helpful at this stage.

Hang in there, and know you have people who’ve both been there and who care about how you are doing!",
Did you work while in opioid withdrawals?,"I worked through most of the withdrawals. Honestly, it might not be so bad to go back to work. The movement and exercise will be very good for your symptoms. Exercise really helped me get through it, and even working helped. I wasn’t sitting at home, focusing on how miserable I was.",
How to get your life together after quitting opioids?,"Don't expect the world to change so quickly. Realize that you are doing something just by quitting opioids. Thats going to take a lot of what you have to give right now. They say one day at a time, and that really does work. Set small, obtainable goals. Mow the lawn, clean a room of your house, cook a big dinner, do whatever little exercise you can muster. Tomorrow you'll be able to do a little more. Best wishes buddy!",
Why can’t I quit opioid use?,"Make yourself a plan and stick to it. You will feel more empowered if you go into to battle feeling well armed. Supplements, mild exercise regime, etc. You can do this!",
How to not get fired from work while quitting opioids?,I took one day off during the week. All I can say is push through. I work at a hospital taking care of patients. When I would get busy it was almost a blessing. Sometimes you do better when you have no other choice but to be strong.,
"I started using opioids to help with anxiety, depression and pain. It was a band-aid to my problems that ended up taking over my life. The euphoria was a fabrication that muted the real experiences of life. My anxiety would subside, but my emotions numbed. I am so tired of living under the drug haze and I am finally opioid free for the the first time in 5 years. However, this stage of withdrawal is hitting me hard. I will not give up and there is no going back. Knowing that I am not alone in this journey makes all the difference. Addiction does not define us. Has anyone experienced something similar?","Great job, your journey sounds amazing! I’m 38 days clean, my longest quit. I didn’t think I could do it, but I figured I’d give it everything I had to. By a month I was feeling so much better, I still would have moments of depression or irritability, but they would usually pass, sometimes in the evenings I would get down, but I just tried to distract myself as best I could, even if it was just endlessly scrolling through TikTok. Now, I look forward to the future, I feel free! Hang on, do everything you have to just wait it out, don’t let your brain start trying to tell you it wasn’t that bad when you were using opioids, you know how hard life became for you, if you just give it a little time you will see how much easier things will feel.",
"I feel sick and miserable. Opioid use is robbing me of my career potential and isolating me from my loved ones. I am sleeping too much, being lazy, and feeling sick. So much money wasted on opioids. What is it going to get me out of opioid use?","Throw out your stash of opioids, drink tons of water and eat super healthy, exercise (gym, run, walk), experience nature, pick up a new or old hobby, and recognize that everything will get better despite how bleak it feels in the beginning.",
"Hi there! So I finally reached out for help and found a detox clinic that I will go to first thing tomorrow morning. I have tried to quit many times myself but I usually fail at day 5 every time. I am suddenly back to my regular opioid usage! I feel completely powerless over this addiction, even though I am very active in a 12 step program and have a sponsor. Have anyone else been to a clinic or taken professional help with quitting opoids?","Congrats, I did 30 days at a rehab facility. Was using opoids for 2.5 years. I’m 91 days opoid free now, never imagined I would make it this far, but I feel amazing and life has never been better. You got this!",
Does anyone know of a doctor around Michigan or Chicago that knows about opoids? I have been a mess after quitting. I had my own business that I can't do now and I am in constant panic. I have tried everything. Medication-assisted treatment/therapy/30 day mental rehab. I do not know what to do at this point. It all started after I quit opoids.,"When was your quitting date? Unfortunately, this is a long process but you will return to your pre-opioid mental state. The timing just depends on how much and for how long you were using opioids. Hang in there my friend!",
Has anyone tried keeping a quitting journal for opioid use? How was your experience?,"Yes! I kept a journal while I was quitting opoid use. I keep a journal to this day. It was/is effective for keeping track that I stayed on track in my recovery journey. Helps to get feelings/emotions out too. It's effective for looking back at my progress and/or ""failings"". Hope it works for you! Quit. And stay quit.",
Anyone need a buddy to quit opoids?,"Day 6 in the quitting process here! Everyone is welcome for mutual support! If you don't mind the fact that I am from Europe and my English is not perfect, I would like to be your quitting buddy :) I have enough time this month so feel free to get in contact anytime.",
What are some of the best items to put in a care package for my employee who is quitting opioid use?,"God bless you! This is the best that you can do for your employee. They have a hard time ahead of them so any support will be appreciated. But most importantly I think is they need someone who checks on them periodically, just asking how they are doing and if there is anything they may need help with. This human support would be priceless. All the best to you and to your employee!",
How do you deal with cravings for opioids?,"I have found that I have to train my brain to recognize the ""lie"" of using again. The lies can come in the form of excuses (e.g., my cat died, etc.), or justifications (this withdrawal is hurting so much). Once I recognize the lie, I turn it into the truth, i.e, ""Just a little opioid use"" will turn into daily usage again eventually. I go do something productive. For example, I attempt to help someone without any expectation of reward in return. The action of helping is the reward. Do something! Exercise or work-out or go for a walk. Whatever it takes!",
What made you want to quit opioid use?,"I wanted to quit because opioids created a false sense of wellbeing, which destroyed many otherwise great things. It masked and numbed my emotions, to the point where I felt very empty, which just made me want to use more opioids. Opoids comes into our lives like a knight in shining armour, usually at a hard time. Then makes itself an unwelcomed guest that's very hard to evict. Detox was extremely hard on me (especially after years of heavy usage). Our bodies take time to recalibrate, but it's going to be worth it to experience life the way God intended (experiencing both good and bad).",
I am 13 months clean! Is this a break through?,"Yes, definitely! I am a few years clean myself. I try to let heavy opioid users like me know -- it takes more time than you think. I connect with your experience, and I am excited for your journey to recovery!",
"How do I curb the craving for kratom? I think about it when I wake up, when I am eating, and when I am working. I feel very bored without it and that is essentially my only noticeable withdrawal symptom (the craving). Any tips?",Whenever I have cravings I go outside and play basketball or try and talk to friends (even online friends). You need something that you can distract your mind with. While quitting opioids your body tends to have more energy and your mind is not sure what to do with the extra time. Even small tasks such as putting together puzzles could help.,
Why is everyone who is on suboxone actively trying to get off of them? Can someone explain to me why people so desperately want off of this drug? I am new to this and I actually was able to stop all opioid use for the first time in 5 years with the help of suboxone.,My life is so much better after ~10 years on suboxone. Having that time to form new habits and healthy thought patterns is the only reason I am alive. Suboxone can be a lifeline and I don’t regret getting on it. Good luck and don’t measure your experience by that of anyone else. That’s the best advice I can give!,
I have read that methadone clinics are decreasing and the trend is for suboxone to be used as an opiate replacement medicine. Is this the case in general?,"To be honest, I think suboxone is going to stop working for everyone because everyone is going to continue doing opioids and we all know the horrors of precipitated withdrawals.",
"Relapsed after 7 months and unfortunately been using more or less for one week now. Stopped yesterday, I just can’t stand it any longer. Just seeing me with these pinpoint pupils all the time. Ugh. Hate it. I guess I will have withdrawal again at this point and I am scared. How did I end up here again? I regret this so much. I have spent the last few months abroad but once I returned to my home country, boom, back at it. 20+ years of opiates by the way. Took me a long time to feel more or less good bodywise (several months). And now this.","After one week, you should not experience more than a day or two of minor restlessness! You’ll be fine just jump back on the wagon and leave this relapse in the past! I let my 2 week relapse turn into a 4 year suboxone dependency and now I’m fighting to get clean again. Don’t do what I did. Please.",
"It would be pretty awesome if more people could show a shred of decency and awareness and not shit on those who have chosen to pursue medically assisted detox. Just because someone is on suboxone or methadone does not mean they do not have the right to celebrate their recovery and milestones and, yes, even call themselves clean. Each and every one of our recovery journeys is unique, and ultimately it’s up to the individual to define what recovery means to them. For me, the most important part of recovery is being able to live happily and healthily. For the next guy, the most important thing may be complete abstinence from everything. Neither one of us has the right to dictate how the other chooses to think of their own progress. But more importantly, it is so completely and utterly inappropriate to say to someone in early recovery that their clean time does not count because they have sought professional medical help. Hearing something like that when I was first dealing with the painful and terrifying transition from active addiction to living without abusing opiates? That would have hurt and discouraged me so deeply. I needed love and support more than anything during that time. I am just begging you guys to think critically about the repercussions of tearing people down who are already at rock bottom. Do you really want to be the reason that someone gave up trying to recover? Because it was more important to you to make a point than to consider the bigger picture?","Thank you for sharing this. I am going to finally begin my own suboxone program. Knowing that there are people willing to share their own experience of using suboxone is comforting. This might be one of the hardest things I have had to do in my whole life, yet I am more ready than ever before. I cannot wait to start using suboxone. Thank you for sharing, especially for those of us who have never begun our journey to recovery.",
"Hi, I am new to this group. I am looking for some advice. I went to California from Florida to surprise my son for his birthday last monday. His 19th birthday was on that thursday. He has struggled with addiction to pills for four years. Started with benzos for 2.5 years, then while still in Florida switched to snorting, then got into some legal trouble at 17 and said he wanted to start over. So, he moved to California to live with his grandparents. When he got to California, the first friend he made at the job we had lined up for him was an opioids dealer. So, obviously, that became his next drug. When I arrived on monday, he was in bad shape. He has been using heavily for 6 months or so. He was trying to taper down but was having horrible withdrawal. The first night I arrived, he was super weird, acting ultra paranoid. Told me to leave. That he has no emotions and planned to never speak to me again. He even rode with me to my Airbnb (30 minutes from the grandparents house) and the second we got inside, demanded that I take him back. So I did. The next morning, I woke up to a text he had sent at 2 am that said he was going to commit suicide. I called him right away and he was fine. He asked me to come get him. I did. He stayed at my Airbnb with me for the next 4 days. It was such a roller coaster. At one point he would be holding my hand, the next he would be raging and at one point he threw something across the room and I had to run out of the house barefoot down the street because I was scared of him. He was using opioids while I was with him. The whole while I was with him, I would be doing research on detox and rehab facilities covered by his insurance, etc. By thursday, on his birthday, he cried and said he would be willing to do anything to get out of the addiction. So, within 10 minutes, at 9 pm, we were loaded up and driving to Los Angeles (2 hours from his friends and grandparents) and he checked himself into a rehab. He is on day 8 of detox right now. He is struggling. He wants to stay sober but at this point, he does not want to stay on for residential or do sober living. It is like he thinks he is “good” after detoxing. He called me two nights ago and asked me where he is going to live after he gets out. He knows that now that his grandparents know about a lot of illegal activities he was doing and the opioids, they just do not feel equipped to have him live with them anymore. To be honest, he brought the scariest, the most criminally involved people to their place, etc. I responded by saying that we are looking into some options for him. I guess I am just asking for advice. I have never dealt with this kind of addiction. Although I have abused substances in the past. But never was dependent on anything. Any advice on how to talk to him? How to deal with his anger toward me despite me trying to avail resources to him? Thanks in advance.","I think you’ve done a great job, but as the saying goes “if you’re looking for trouble, you’ll find it”. I always said I was fine after detox. I wasn’t because 15 years later I’m still on the merry-go-round. I would recommend the full 30 days, most people relapse right after detox and unfortunately rehab too and that’s when your tolerance has gone down and overdoses happen. Ask him to do the 30 days so you have time to figure out a place for him to live. Do you have any other family after he completes rehab? As far as how he treats you, his grandparents, that is the disease talking. I bet you already know this deep down. The moment that you start to get sick, your brain is hijacked by this demon that won’t stop scratching your insides until you “feed it”. I love my father more than anyone in the world, I would take a bullet for him without thinking but when the switch is flipped, I have gotten into physical altercations. I’ve thrown things and broken his $600 TV. I’ve done the most awful things ever. I have promised 100,000x “today is it! I’m done!” and now he can’t trust me. The point being is when the smoke clears he knows you love him and have done anything and everything to help him. Keep believing he’ll get better and telling him you know he will. Okay, I’m going to be honest, if you let him out after “detox” he will still be in slight withdrawal and the same lack of coping mechanisms and will use. As Einstein said, “the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result”. I would definitely try to get him to stay as long as possible. I sincerely pray that your son gets clean and he will apologize for everything (guilt and shame is a trigger), he will thank you for your love and support (we know we’re not easy to love), and I pray that you have peace even though you’re unsure of what’s next. Relapse is a part of recovery and most of us don’t get it right the first time. Have you heard of sublocade or vivitrol? They’re monthly injections that appease the opiate receptors in our brain and also will make you unable to feel anything but sick if you use opioids. I believe they are covered by insurance. I don’t have insurance so I use suboxone, it works but the hardest part for me is that you have to be in moderate withdrawal and you take it once a day. I wish you luck, you’re a great mom and he loves you. You have to remember love isn’t enough, he’s got to REALLY want it. You’re both in my prayers, I hope I helped at least a little. God bless you both.",
What got you to try heroin (an opioid) for the first time and what keeps you still doing it?,"I tried it for the first time because my doctor years back was overprescribing Perc 30s to me after a major surgery I had. She left her practice. The new doctor I was reassigned to wouldn't prescribe me Perc 30s so I was stuck with a bad habit and needed something close to it and fast. When I first tried heroin I instantly fell in love. I’ve been using it on and off for close to 10 years now. I continue to use it today because I’ve had numerous other surgeries and suffer from severe chronic pain. I use it nowadays for therapeutic needs. So pretty much I use it for what heroin originally was intended to be used for. I depend on it more than I have fun with it. But of course, I enjoy the warm numbing feeling I get from it and always will enjoy that.",
"Have any of you ever made some horrible decisions while in active addiction? I certainly have more than what I would like to admit. You know eventually they catch up with you, well today is the day one is catching up with me. Please send me good vibes so that it will not turn out as bad as I think. There are not enough opioids in the world to numb this stress. Ugh. I hope you all are having a much better day than me.","Best advice I’ve ever gotten was, “Don’t let the mistakes of your past keep you from living your life today.” The sooner you accept the reality of your actions, the sooner you figure out the best way to deal with them. You said it, things could always be worse, always. Us junkies think we have it bad spending the rent money on a binge or two, but at least we’re not chronic gamblers. Imagine spending the rent playing slots, or blackjack for several hours. At least we get to get high, what do they get?",
Junkies unite! I started falling asleep at work today and I got sent home. I know I am going to have to talk to my supervisor tomorrow so I need to prepare myself. I am thinking I am going to say I got food poisoning or ate some kind of food that was left out all night from christmas eve and thus I spent most of christmas night getting sick in the bathroom. Can anyone please help me think of a common food that could have been left out for too long? I am thinking maybe mayonnaise from a sandwich.,"I think you are overthinking it. Yeah, just tell your supervisor that you have been suffering from some short term insomnia and were running on almost no sleep but due to your dedication to the job and loyalty to your employer you wouldn't call in sick and just had to come to work and try to make it through the day because you had something important that needed to be done that day (like not letting someone else down that was depending on you for something). My God, us addicts sure learn quickly to be good lairs! Yeah if he buys that he’ll likely give you a raise!",
At my grandparents for the holidays and found an old hydrocodone/acetaminophen prescription. Wondering how much would be a good amount for a first timer to get high?,"Good job stealing from your poor, old grandparents! Congratulations on progressing to the next stage on your way to becoming a “full blown junkie”!",
"Once I am clean, how should I go about telling people about my past addiction to heroin? The only people that know are my parents. None of my friends, no one else. I live in a wealthy area, due to my parents, and people look down upon drug addicts heavily. I feel like even once I am clean, people would still look at me as less than them if I told them I had an addiction.","I tell people about my past addictions when I feel comfortable with it. They need to reveal some honest information about them. If they think less of me for addictions, they don’t need to be my friends. Honestly, most people often love a good comeback kid. They like to see people who have made it out alive. I don’t drop all my secrets (“for a while I really abused drugs and alcohol, but I’ve learned better coping skills since then”) until I’m ready, but being vague works for me most of the time. I’m not ashamed of who I am, and I won't let anyone put shame on me. However, I reveal what I’m comfortable with as I get there.",
"This is going to sound crazy, but although I was addicted to pain pills for 10+ years, I never knew what a methadone clinic was until I walked into one this spring. If I would have known then what I know now! There is a methadone clinic about 40 minutes from my house. I have been going there since April. I am one of the 4 suboxone patients out of roughly 1,400 other (methadone) patients. Why do I go there instead of a doctor? I’ll make it quick. It keeps me honest. I see a lot of people here planning for withdrawal, talking about how they know it’s coming in a few days. I am not preaching methadone clinics to anyone, you all are grown adults and you are going to do what you want to do. My question is this, if you know you are going to be in withdrawal, why not go to a methadone clinic to avoid the sickness? Obviously there are reasons, otherwise everyone would do it. I am going to repeat myself and make this clear. I am not promoting methadone clinics. I am not pushing suboxone or methadone on you. I am not telling you to quit opioids. I am an addict just like you. Never did judge, never will. I just want to hear some reasons!","Because most clinics have waiting lists. Cost $200 a week and usually an initial payment. They also have different clinics, where some are insurance only, private only. It’s much easier to buy suboxone off the street and detox that way. It also keeps your medical record clean and name out of government databases.",
