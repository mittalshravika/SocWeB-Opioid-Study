      "Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is trading one addiction for another.",
    "Reddit response":
      "This myth originates from the delivery system in methadone maintenance treatment, in which participants must visit a methadone clinic daily to receive their medication. People have a mistaken belief that taking a medication like methadone or buprenorphine every day necessarily means you are addicted to it. People who perpetuate this myth fail to understand the immense impact medications have on opioid use disorders. When someone can stop taking a drug they get high on without experiencing withdrawal, the uncontrollable drug-seeking urges that characterize addiction are minimized or eliminated. Participants are not getting high. They are eliminating their usage of drugs of abuse and the medication facilitates the mental and emotional stability required for participating in other aspects of recovery.",

    "Question (Reddit post)": "MAT is worse than abstinence.",
    "Reddit response":
      "Evidence simply does not support abstinence as the most effective method of treating opioid addiction. In fact, MAT is so much more effective that the FDA is actively encouraging the development of novel MAT medications. According to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar, 'The evidence is clear: medication-assisted treatment works, and it is a key piece of defeating the drug crisis facing our country.' Complete abstinence from opioids and MAT medications is an admirable goal and one that can be achieved in the long run with treatment. However, promoting abstinence as somehow better or more effective than MAT is factually incorrect.",

    "Question (Reddit post)": "OUD is a choice, not a disease.",
    "Reddit response":
      "One of the most damaging misconceptions about the opioid epidemic is that it stems from a series of poor choices. This oversimplification ignores the complex nature of addiction and the numerous factors influencing its development. Medical institutions worldwide acknowledge OUD as a disease – a chronic and relapsing disorder that affects the brain. OUD alters the brain’s structure and function, causing individuals to experience overpowering cravings, impaired judgment, and an obsessive urge to use drugs, despite the harmful repercussions. Like any other disease, Opioid Use Disorder needs to be approached with a treatment-focused mindset rather than a judgmental one.",

    "Question (Reddit post)": "Relapse means treatment has failed.",
    "Reddit response":
      "Many people perceive relapse, the return to drug use after an attempt to stop, as a sign that treatment has failed. Like many other chronic diseases, relapses are often a part of the OUD recovery journey. Instead of viewing them as failures, they should be seen as indicators that the treatment plan needs to be adjusted or intensified.",

      "Stereotypes often label people with OUD as weak or morally flawed, further exacerbating the stigma and discrimination they face. OUD is not a moral failing. It’s high time that we replace judgment and stigmatization with understanding and support, providing assistance and empathy instead of criticism and scorn.",
